# Control Flow
## IF
This checks a condition, and if it's true, the indented code block under it will be executed.
```python
if True:
    print("Inside if block")
```

# Indentation and Comments

## IF-ELSE
```python
if True:
    print("Inside if block")
else:
    print("Inside Else block")
```

[![Python IF-ELSE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lE3IGtyXjLg/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/lE3IGtyXjLg)


```python
a=10
b=20
if a>b:
    print("a is greater than b")
else:
    print("a is not greater than b")
```


## IF-ELIF
```python
x = 10
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x == 10:
    print("x is exactly 10")
elif x < 10:
    print("x is less than 10")
```

## IF-ELIF-ELSE
```python
x = 10
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x == 10:
    print("x is exactly 10")
else:
    print("x is less than 10")
```
A more general format would be
```python
if condition:
    pass
elif condition:
    pass
else:
    pass
```

## Nested IFs
You can also nest conditional statements for more complex checks
```python
x = 15
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
    if x > 20:
        print("x is also greater than 20")
    else:
        print("x is not greater than 20")
```
